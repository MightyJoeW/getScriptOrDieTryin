Learning how to code is an unrivaled modern experience. As an aspiring developer, no matter what level you’re at, you have a unique and fascinating story to tell based on your personal experiences and creations.

However, lacking the ability to effectively tell your story or generate interest can lead to many missed opportunities. Alexander Kallaway’s #100DaysOfCode challenge encourages you to code for at least an hour every day for 100 days. The challenge provides a helpful sample log for documenting and sharing your daily progress.

While I truly appreciate the sample log, the story-teller in me wouldn’t allow my log to look identical to everyone else’s. Plus, I couldn’t imagine anyone reading through my 100 text-based entries (besides possibly my mom).
